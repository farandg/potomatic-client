# POTOMATIC-CLIENT

This is the repo for POTOMATIC's client-side code.

## ARCHITECTURE

At the moment, POTOMATIC is only designed to run on an armv6 architecture like that of the Raspberry Pi Zero.  
Later developments will include different types of open source microcontrollers depending on the architecture needed.  
The code will be made available just as soon as each comes out of the testing phase.
